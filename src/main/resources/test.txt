The address the socket server listens on. It will get the value returned from
 java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName() if not configured.
   FORMAT:
     listeners = listener_name://host_name:port
   EXAMPLE:
     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092

 Hostname and port the broker will advertise to producers and consumers. If not set,
 it uses the value for "listeners" if configured.  Otherwise, it will use the value
 returned from java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092

 Maps listener names to security protocols, the default is for them to be the same. See the config documentation for more details
listener.security.protocol.map=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL

 The number of threads that the server uses for processing requests, which may include disk I/O
num.io.threads=8

 The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=102400

 The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400

 The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600
